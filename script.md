Entire Game on One Screen
-------------------------

`grey text on a black background`
You are asleep.

> open eyes

Ugh. You had been having such a plesant nap, but the thought of the upcoming deadline coaxes you awake, slightly groggy.

You are sitting in a comfortable chair in a dark room. You can feel the gentle contours of a computer mouse under your right hand.

> move hand

Almost immediately you are blinded by a large computer screen less than a meter from your face. `simulated bright light?` It eagerly burns your retinas with the image of your half completed game.

> look at game

Truth be told, it's nowhere close to halfway complete. Just a couple of abstract sprites that will hopefully replace the red and green rectangles currently sliding back and forth across a dark grey background. 

> look at clock

You glance towards the corner of the screen. Again.

3:47

Almost ten hours since the theme was announced. Ugh again.

It will be getting light outside soon. You need rest.

> get back to work

You try to focus on the task at hand. Just need to get this sprite looking decent and then you can import it into the engine...

[goto beginning]()

> look at game (again)

The red and green rectangles slide endlessly back and forth.

> look at clock (again)

You glance towards the corner of the screen yet again.

Unfortunately, time has continued to move forward. Another minute gone.

> go to bed

No need to feel defeated. It's not like you could complete the entire game without any sleep at all.

You shuffle past your trusty alarm clock (better known as a cell phone) as it charges from your computer and walk into your room. climb into bed.

> brainstorm

In the interest of making every minute count, you decide to use this time to bounce around more ideas for your game.

> close eyes

You close your eyes and wait for sleep to come. `without brainstorm in bed`
`or`
You close your eyes in thought. `with brainstorm in bed`

> move hand

You shift your hand to a more comfortable position.

> open eyes

`background color and text color crossfade to black on white`
It is very bright in your room. Sunlight is winning the battle against the closed blinds in your bedroom window.

> leave bed

(climb out of bed)

> look at clock

You walk back to your desk and convince your phone to follow your example and wake up.

It is well past noon.

Oops. You don't normally have an alarm set on weekends, but you really could have used one this time.

Oh well.

> get back to work
