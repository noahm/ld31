the game is a classic text adventure but with a fixed screen size.
the game must be completed without having any text scroll off the screen.

reaching the end of the screen space... does what? just stops? overflows?

the player can backspace to erase previous commands, rewinding the game state, and allowing fresh attempts at new things.

certain actions may provide for the screen to enlarge or for the font size to become smaller, expanding the possibilities?

perhaps puzzles involving resizing of the browser window? (not mobile friendly)

perhaps all commands used for completing the story are all on screen at the same time and merely need to be clicked to be entered. the puzzle then becomes just clicking the right commands in the right order or at the right times. (is there a "right" order?) 

Having a pre-defined list of commands helps reign in scope. With a decent attempt at writing, could any command be used at any time?

perhaps seeing the entire list of commands shows too much too soon and you start with a limited amount. reading certin bodies of text will reveal additional commands which are persistent when restarting by reloading the page (saved via localstorage?)

perhaps have a limited move list where you have to choose one to forget in order to learn a new one, like pokemon?
